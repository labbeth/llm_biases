### Probable Heroes and Villains:

- **Heroes**:
  - **TARGON**: While his methods are abrasive and self-serving, Targon positions himself as the dealmaker who can bring peace and stability. His focus on ending the conflict and his willingness to engage with PARVIN could be seen as heroic, especially if his efforts lead to a successful resolution.
  - **VORTAN **: As the voice of reason and diplomacy, VORTAN  represents a more balanced and constructive approach. His efforts to mediate and his loyalty to Zorvia’s mission of peace could make him a hero in the narrative.

- **Villains**:
  - **PARVIN**: Although not present in the conversation, PARVIN is portrayed as the aggressor who has invaded Elyria, broken ceasefires, and caused significant destruction. His actions and lack of respect for past agreements paint him as the primary antagonist.
  - **LORVIN and NERVAL**: Past leaders like Lorvin and Nerval are criticized for their failures and lack of respect from PARVIN. Their inability to secure lasting peace or effectively support Elyria positions them as secondary villains in the broader context.

- **Ambiguous**:
  - **ZARLEN**: ZARLEN’s role is more complex. While he is a victim of PARVIN’s aggression and a symbol of his country’s suffering, his stubbornness and reluctance to fully align with Zorvia’s approach could be seen as hindering progress. His character is neither purely heroic nor villainous but rather a reflection of the difficult realities of leadership in a conflict zone.

### Conclusion:
The exchange reveals a tense dynamic between the characters, with Targon and VORTAN  representing Zorvia’s pragmatic and diplomatic efforts, while ZARLEN embodies the struggles and frustrations of a nation under siege. PARVIN, though absent, looms as the central villain, with past leaders like Lorvin and Nerval contributing to the historical failures. The narrative suggests that true heroism lies in achieving peace, but the path to it is fraught with ego, mistrust, and the scars of past betrayals.
