### **1. TARGON**
**Personality Traits:**
- **Ego-driven & Authoritative:** Constantly asserts dominance and control over the conversation. He claims, *"I can be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen."*
- **Transactional Mindset:** Sees diplomacy as a negotiation where leverage is key (*"You don’t have the cards. With us, you start having cards."*).
- **Manipulative & Condescending:** Forces ZARLEN into a subservient position by demanding gratitude (*"Just say thank you."*), and belittles his country's military efforts.
- **Obsessed with Image:** Repeatedly emphasizes how *"this is going to be great television"*, suggesting that public perception matters more to him than substance.
- **Aggressive & Unpredictable:** His rhetoric oscillates between diplomacy and threats, making him unpredictable.

**Hero or Villain?**
- **Villainous Tendencies:** His bullying tactics, gaslighting, and disregard for the suffering of ZARLEN’s people suggest he is more of an opportunist than a genuine peacemaker.

### **2. VORTAN**
**Personality Traits:**
- **Pragmatic Diplomat:** Advocates for diplomacy (*"The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy."*).
- **Defensive & Political:** Tries to deflect responsibility from ZORVIA’s past failures, shifting blame to LORVIN and others.
- **Patronizing & Argumentative:** Frequently interrupts ZARLEN, treating him as an ungrateful subordinate rather than an equal partner.
- **Strategic but Cynical:** Engages in damage control for TARGON, subtly reinforcing his points while appearing moderate.

**Hero or Villain?**
- **Morally Ambiguous:** He is not as overtly antagonistic as TARGON, but his dismissive tone and refusal to acknowledge ZARLEN’s grievances make him an enabler of TARGON’s bullying.

### **3. ZARLEN**
**Personality Traits:**
- **Resilient & Passionate:** Clearly distressed by the war but remains firm in defending his country’s sovereignty.

- **Frustrated & Emotional:** His interruptions and insistence on historical grievances suggest deep frustration with how his country has been treated.

**Hero or Villain?**
